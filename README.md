# BMW Vehicle Project 

This project is a simple Python application that models BMW vehicles using object-oriented programming (OOP). It demonstrates inheritance with a main class (`BMW`) and three child classes: `BMWCar`, `BMWMotorcycle`, and `BMWSUV`.

### Features

- Each vehicle has basic attributes:
  - Model
  - Horsepower (HP)
  - Torque (Nm)
  - 0-100 km/h acceleration (seconds)
  - Top Speed (km/h)

- Child classes have **unique attributes**:
  - **BMWCar**: `car_type` (Sedan/Coupe) and `fuel_type` (Petrol/Diesel)
  - **BMWMotorcycle**: `bike_type` (Sport/Adventure) and `displacement` (cc)
  - **BMWSUV**: `drive_type` (FWD/RWD/AWD) and `ground_clearance` (mm)

- The `show_info()` method prints all relevant information for each vehicle, with a separator line for clarity.

### Example Vehicles

- BMW M4 Competition 2025
- BMW 320d 2025
- BMW S1000RR 2025
- BMW R1300GS 2025
- BMW X6 M60i 2025
- BMW X1 2025
